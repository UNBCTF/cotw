# Challenges

## How to add a challenge

Currently you add a challenge by creating a docker container for each chall and placing it in the challenges/ folder.


Examples exist in challenges/web/.


In the docker-compose file you must specify expose ports you wish to use.


Make sure to update landing/src/index.html to show ur chall. Use files/ to distribute assets (i.e challenge file)
